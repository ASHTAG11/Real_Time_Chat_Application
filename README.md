*DESCRIPTION* : Chit-Chat is a real-time messaging web application built using React (Vite) on the client side and Node.js + Socket.io on the backend. This project enables users to communicate instantly with each other inside a shared chat room environment. The primary focus of the application is to provide seamless live messaging, a clean UI, and smooth user experience without requiring page refreshes.

The communication is handled through WebSocket connections using Socket.io, ensuring bi-directional event-based data transfer. Once a user joins by entering a name, they are immediately connected to the server, and their presence is updated to all active users in real-time. The application also sends system messages to inform everyone when a user joins or leaves the chat. Messages are styled differently for the sender and receiver, improving readability and interaction clarity.

The UI is designed with a modern pink-themed interface blended with black headers and soft UI accents. It includes a welcome screen, user input interface, message box, online users display, and logout functionality. Smooth chat bubble styling distinguishes personal messages from others, promoting a friendly conversation experience.

This project demonstrates concepts like WebSocket communication, state management with React hooks, real-time broadcasting, UI styling, and multi-client interaction. Chit-Chat can serve as a base structure for building large-scale chat apps, collaborative tools, or community messaging platforms.
